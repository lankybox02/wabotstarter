A simple starter kit for creating a wasteof.money bot using `wasteof-client`.
### Getting started
To get started, clone this repository on replit.com or a programming IDE that supports node.js

Go to the repository shell and type `npm i wasteof-client`. Then, change the `username` and `password` variables to match the bot account.
